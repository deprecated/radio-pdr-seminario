* Structure and dynamics of photodissociation regions
** What is observed
+ Broad and narrow HI RR line components
+ Carbon RR line
+ HI emission

** Physical processes

*** HI RR lines from partially ionized gas
+ This supposedly gives the narrow component
+ Turns out that it is stimulated emission
  + explained in [[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...501..710G][Garay et al (2008)]]


** Models to calculate
*** Cloudy models

**** Cloudy H xsec bug

       Posted to trac site
     :END:
  - https://www.nublado.org/ticket/170
  - occurs on mac and linux
  - could fix it by increasing [[file:~/Work/CLOUDY/SVN/trunk/source/sanity_check.cpp::if%20error%200%2005][this]] to 0.1
***** Update [2010-11-24 Wed]
Still happens - also on linux

**** H recomb lines

Try a model with sufficient levels to do the H92\alpha and H110\alpha lines

*** Radiation MHD models
**** Rescale the box size?
** Papers

+ [[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?library&libname%3DSandra%2BRR%2Blines&libid%3D453398f917][ADS private library]]

*** General papers on carbon radio recomb lines
*** Observations of particular UCHII regions
**** GGD 14
**** Other regions
*** Supposed measurements of magnetic fields

** Fixes to Cloudy code

*** TODO https://github.com/deprecated/cloudy
I am currently initialising a git repo with a shallow copy of the SVN
repo

Then I will make a new branch and start changing things

**** DONE Shallow copy of SVN trunk into a fit repo
     CLOSED: [2010-11-25 Thu 11:43]
**** DONE Post it on github
     CLOSED: [2010-11-25 Thu 11:43]
**** TODO Sync to robbie
