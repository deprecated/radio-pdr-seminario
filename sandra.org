* Structure and dynamics of photodissociation regions
** What is observed
+ Broad and narrow HI RR line components
+ Carbon RR line
+ HI emission

** Physical processes

*** HI RR lines from partially ionized gas
+ This supposedly gives the narrow component
+ Turns out that it is stimulated emission
  + explained in [[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1998ApJ...501..710G][Garay et al (2008)]]


** Models to calculate
*** Cloudy models

**** H recomb lines

Try a model with sufficient levels to do the H92\alpha and H110\alpha lines

*** Radiation MHD models
**** Rescale the box size?
** Papers
